name: deepchem
description: Molecular ML with diverse featurizers and pre-built datasets. Use for property prediction (ADMET, toxicity) with traditional ML or GNNs when you want extensive featurization options and MoleculeNet benchmarks. Best for quick experiments with pre-trained models, diverse molecular representations. For graph-first PyTorch workflows use torchdrug; for benchmark datasets use pytdc.

# AMA Mobile Remote Compute Skill

This skill is installed as part of `scientific-compute-remote`. The upstream desktop skill depends on Python, scientific packages, GPU/simulation/model runtimes, large local files, or other non-iOS execution. On AMA iOS, do not run local scripts, package managers, notebooks, shell commands, or desktop tools.

## Required Mobile Flow

1. Read the request and identify the intended scientific compute task.
2. Use the reference files below when they help explain inputs, outputs, terminology, or expected artifacts.
3. Before promising execution, call `run_intent` with intent `scientific.remote_job_preflight`.
4. Treat any blocked status as final for local iOS execution. Explain the blocker and the next required setup step.
5. Only describe a remote job as ready when the preflight status is `ready_for_remote_job`.

Recommended `run_intent` parameters:

```json
{
  "skill": "deepchem",
  "task": "plain-language user task",
  "requiresRemoteExecution": true,
  "hasRemoteProvider": false,
  "inputArtifactCount": 0,
  "containsSensitiveData": false,
  "userApprovedUpload": false
}
```

## iOS Runtime Rules

- Local scripts executed: `false`.
- Local Python, shell, MATLAB, Docker, GPU, notebook, or package-manager execution: unavailable on iOS.
- Artifact upload requires explicit user approval.
- PHI, secrets, controlled datasets, and private research data require a data review before remote execution.

## Reference Files Installed

- `references/api_reference.md`
- `references/workflows.md`
