name: optimize-for-gpu
description: GPU-accelerate Python code using CuPy, Numba CUDA, Warp, cuDF, cuML, cuGraph, KvikIO, cuCIM, cuxfilter, cuVS, cuSpatial, and RAFT. Use whenever the user mentions GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA acceleration, or wants to speed up NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, scikit-image, NetworkX, GeoPandas, or Faiss workloads. Covers physics simulation, differentiable rendering, mesh ray casting, particle systems (DEM/SPH/fluids), vector/similarity search, GPUDirect Storage file IO, interactive dashboards, geospatial analysis, medical imaging, and sparse eigensolvers. Also use when you see CPU-bound Python code (loops, large arrays, ML pipelines, graph analytics, image processing) that would benefit from GPU acceleration, even if not explicitly requested.

# AMA Mobile Remote Compute Skill

This skill is installed as part of `scientific-compute-remote`. The upstream desktop skill depends on Python, scientific packages, GPU/simulation/model runtimes, large local files, or other non-iOS execution. On AMA iOS, do not run local scripts, package managers, notebooks, shell commands, or desktop tools.

## Required Mobile Flow

1. Read the request and identify the intended scientific compute task.
2. Use the reference files below when they help explain inputs, outputs, terminology, or expected artifacts.
3. Before promising execution, call `run_intent` with intent `scientific.remote_job_preflight`.
4. Treat any blocked status as final for local iOS execution. Explain the blocker and the next required setup step.
5. Only describe a remote job as ready when the preflight status is `ready_for_remote_job`.

Recommended `run_intent` parameters:

```json
{
  "skill": "optimize-for-gpu",
  "task": "plain-language user task",
  "requiresRemoteExecution": true,
  "hasRemoteProvider": false,
  "inputArtifactCount": 0,
  "containsSensitiveData": false,
  "userApprovedUpload": false
}
```

## iOS Runtime Rules

- Local scripts executed: `false`.
- Local Python, shell, MATLAB, Docker, GPU, notebook, or package-manager execution: unavailable on iOS.
- Artifact upload requires explicit user approval.
- PHI, secrets, controlled datasets, and private research data require a data review before remote execution.
